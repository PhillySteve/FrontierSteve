- 👋 Hello,, I’m @FrontierSteve
- 👀 I’m interested in Windows Print Server Administration.  I would like to get more knowledgable on Dell print servers.
- 🌱 My company currently uses Bottomline Technologies ECI (eCommIntegrate).  It's looks like an old-fashioned control language derived from maybe DEC/VAX.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on java or C utilities that can scan/monitor a folder for PDFs, and once one lands, it will automatically print.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
